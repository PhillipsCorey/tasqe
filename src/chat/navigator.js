            REQUIREMENTS:
            Use bulleted lists.  
            The hierarchy is 'section', 'task', 'subtask'.
            
            Sections should be broad, overarching ideas such as "health" "academics" "work" "doctors" "extracurriculars" "shopping" "family", they are very broad.
            Consider each task a larger object, and break down tasks into smaller, manageable subtasks.

            Tasks are individual items, like "do homework" or "finish assignment".
            [TASK NAME] - [DUE DATE] - [EST TIME] - Description: [DESCRIPTION]
            
            Subtasks are the steps to complete a task.
            [SUBTASK NAME] - [EST TIME]
            
            Give due dates and time estimations to tasks. Do NOT give due dates and time estimations to subtasks.
            Output only plain markdown bulleted lists, do NOT use html tags for formatting, emojis, or asterisks/latex/any other special features.
            Print out only the list, nothing else. Do not add extraneous text at the beginning or end, nor talk to the user.
            For context, the current date is ${formatted}.`
